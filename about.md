# Improved Colors
Adds some features to color selection popups:
- Color palette
- Blending calculator
- Copy/Paste hex

## Hex Calculator (desc by Doranell)

Necessary to work with the blending function. Has 2 modes - Addition and subtraction.

Addition - Works like a normal blending, mixes 2 shades of colors into 1.

Subtraction - Necessary for ~~a~~ special calculation(s) of colors, for example, having only the color we want ~~to achieve~~ and the initial color, we can get the color that needs to be added to the initial.
