# Improved Colors
Adds some features to color selection popups:
- Color palette
- Blending calculator
- Copy/Paste hex

**NAMED EDITOR GROUPS AUTOMATICALLY DISABLES COLOR PALETTE, CANT FIX BECAUSE THE MOD CRASHES MY GAME, WILL BE FIXED WITH THE MODS DEV FIXES THE CRASH :3**


## Hex Calculator (desc by Doranell)

Necessary to work with the blending function. Has 2 modes - Addition and subtraction.

Addition - Works like a normal blending, mixes 2 shades of colors into 1.

Subtraction - Necessary for special calculation of colors, for example, having only the color we want and the initial color, we can get the color that needs to be added to the initial.
